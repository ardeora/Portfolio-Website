              After getting feedback on the first part of my final project, I
              realized that to truly explore TikTok's impact on song popularity,
              I'd need to scrape private data from the platform, which isn't
              feasible. So, I've decided to switch topics.

            New Project: Movie Posters
          </h2>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p>
              I'm a huge movie buff and love design. I've spent countless hours
              admiring movie posters and even creating my own with my
              (admittedly scrappy) Photoshop skills. This got me thinking: how
              do the colors in movie posters stir our emotions? Is it possible
              to guess a movie's genre just by its poster's color scheme? Do
              certain genres lean towards specific colors in their posters? I'm
              excited to dive into this and see how color choices in movie
              posters connect with the film's genre and the feelings they aim to
              evoke.
            </p>

        <div>
          <h2 className="pb-1 text-2xl font-semibold">Storyboard</h2>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p>
              To kick off this story, I want to show different movie posters
              that all share a common theme: each features one person in the
              center of the image, but each poster uses a different color
              scheme. Then, I'll focus on each poster individually to highlight
              how the color might make the audience feel. For example, a red
              poster could create a sense of alertness or horror, while a yellow
              poster might give off a calm and peaceful vibe. An orange poster
              could evoke feelings of warmth and energy, and a pink one might
              suggest romance or playfulness.

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p>
              Then I will introduce the concept of color psychology and how
              different colors can evoke different emotions. I will use this
              information to analyze the color schemes of the movie posters and
              discuss how they might influence the audience's perception of the
              film. I will also explore how different genres use color to convey
              different moods and themes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, I will create a visualization that shows the color
              distribution of movie posters in different genres. I will use this
              visualization to identify trends and patterns in the use of color
              in movie posters and to explore how color choices vary across
              different genres.

            <p>
              For each color, I'll include a collage page filled with different
              movie posters that use that color prominently. This will help set
              the mood and prepare the audience for the visualizations that are
              about to follow.

            </div>

            <p>
              Next, I'll display an image I created by collecting various movie
              posters that predominantly feature red in their color schemes. I
              took all these red movie posters, compressed them, and arranged
              them side by side. This image showcases the different shades of
              red used in movie posters.
            </p>

            <div>
              <img src="/imgs/tswd/a5/7.png" alt="Color Red" />
            </div>

            <p>
              I will then show a bar chart that shows the genre distribution of
              movie posters that use the color red. This chart will help
              illustrate how different genres use the color red in their movie
              posters.
            </p>

            <div>
              <img src="/imgs/tswd/a5/6.png" alt="Color Red" />
            </div>

            <p>
              Additionally, I'll include radar charts that showcase different
              movie genres and highlight which ones most often use red as the
              dominant color in their poster schemes. This will help illustrate
              which genres frequently feature red and how prevalent it is among
              them.
            </p>

            <div>

            </div>

            <p>
              I'll repeat this process for other colors, such as blue, green,
              yellow, and so on, to show how different colors are used in movie
              posters across various genres.
            </p>

            <p>
              As for the call to action in the end, I still need to think about
              that.

                  <li>
                    The feedback indicates that beginning the story with
                    color-themed movie posters featuring a single person is
                    engaging and effective. All three friends agree that this
                    approach immediately captures attention and sets a clear
                    thematic tone. It piques interest by showcasing visually
                    striking images and makes the concept of exploring color and
                    emotion evident from the start.

                  <li>
                    Regarding the radar charts, the consensus is that they add
                    value by providing visual data that complements the theme.
                    They help illustrate the prevalence of certain colors in
                    specific movie genres, adding depth to the narrative.
                    However, it was difficult for all of them to interpret what
                    the ticks on the radar chart meant. Clarifying this would
                    make the visualizations more effective. They suggest adding
                    a legend or explanation to help viewers understand the data
                    better. They also reccomend only showing one radar chart at
                    a time to avoid overwhelming the audience.

                    The overall narrative is perceived as clear and engaging,

                    audience emotions. While the main concept resonates, one
                    suggestion is to include more examples linking specific
                    colors to different genres to strengthen the point of the
                    story. They suggested that adding a summary section at the
                    end of each color deep dive that talks about the emotions
                    that color evokes and how it is used in movie posters would
                    be helpful. This will enable smooth transitions between
